# Pangea Python SDK

A Python SDK for integrating with Pangea Services. [Click here](https://pangea.cloud/docs/#everything-a-builder-needs-united) to check out Pangea services.

## Installation

```
pip3 install pangea-sdk
# or
poetry add pangea-sdk
```

## Usage

For samples apps look at [/examples](https://github.com/pangeacyber/pangea-python/tree/main/examples) folder in this repository. There you will find basic samples apps for each services supported on this SDK. Each service folder has a README.md with intructions to install, setup and run.


## Asyncio support

We have added support to asyncio library using aiohttp in order to support async/await calls to all our services.
Async services classes are inside [pangea/asyncio](https://github.com/pangeacyber/pangea-python/tree/main/packages/pangea-sdk/pangea/asyncio) folder, and examples about how to use them are in [/examples/asyncio](https://github.com/pangeacyber/pangea-python/tree/main/examples/asyncio).


### Secure Audit Service - Integrity Tools

Python Pangea SDK include also some extra features to validate Audit Service log's integrity. Here we explain how to run them.

#### Verify audit data

Verify that an event or a list of events has not been tampered with. Usage:

```
usage: python -m pangea.verify_audit [-h] [--file PATH]
or
usage: poetry run python -m pangea.verify_audit [-h] [--file PATH]

Pangea Audit Verifier

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --file PATH, -f PATH  Input file (default: standard input).
```

It accepts multiple file formats:
- a Verification Artifact from the Pangea User Console
- a search response from the REST API:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${PANGEA_TOKEN}" -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  --data '{"verbose": true}' https://audit.aws.us.pangea.cloud/v1/search
```


#### Bulk Download Audit Data

Download all audit logs for a given time range. Start and end date should be provided,
a variety of formats is supported, including ISO-8601. The result is stored in a
jsonl file (one json per line)

```
usage: python -m pangea.dump_audit [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--domain DOMAIN] [--output OUTPUT] start end
or
usage: poetry run python -m pangea.dump_audit [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--domain DOMAIN] [--output OUTPUT] start end

Pangea Audit Dump Tool

positional arguments:
  start                 Start timestamp. Supports a variety of formats, including ISO-8601. e.g.: 2023-06-05T18:05:15.030667Z
  end                   End timestamp. Supports a variety of formats, including ISO-8601. e.g.: 2023-06-05T18:05:15.030667Z

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --token TOKEN, -t TOKEN
                        Pangea token (default: env PANGEA_TOKEN)
  --domain DOMAIN, -d DOMAIN
                        Pangea base domain (default: env PANGEA_DOMAIN)
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Output file name. Default: dump-<timestamp>
```

#### Perform Exhaustive Verification of Audit Data

This script performs extensive verification on a range of events of the log stream. Appart from verifying the hash
and the membership proof, it checks that there is no omissions in the stream, i.e. all the events are present and properly located.

```
usage: python -m pangea.deep_verify [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--domain DOMAIN] --file FILE
or
usage: poetry run python -m pangea.deep_verify [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--domain DOMAIN] --file FILE

Pangea Audit Event Deep Verifier

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --token TOKEN, -t TOKEN
                        Pangea token (default: env PANGEA_TOKEN)
  --domain DOMAIN, -d DOMAIN
                        Pangea base domain (default: env PANGEA_DOMAIN)
  --file FILE, -f FILE  Event input file. Must be a collection of JSON Objects separated by newlines
```

It accepts multiple file formats:
- a Verification Artifact from the Pangea User Console
- a file generated by the `dump_audit` command
- a search response from the REST API (see `verify_audit`)


## Reporting issues and new features

If faced some issue using or testing this SDK or a new feature request feel free to open an issue [clicking here](https://github.com/pangeacyber/pangea-python/issues).
We would need you to provide some basic information like what SDK's version you are using, stack trace if you got it, framework used, and steps to reproduce the issue.
Also feel free to contact [Pangea support](mailto:support@pangea.cloud) by email or send us a message on [Slack](https://pangea.cloud/join-slack/)


## Contributing

Currently, the setup scripts only have support for Mac/ZSH environments.
Future support is incoming.

To install our linters, simply run `./dev/setup_repo.sh`
These linters will run on every `git commit` operation.
